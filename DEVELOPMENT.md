# Python
Python is used for the backend. If you're new to flask do the official flask quickstart and tutorial before contributing.
## Style
I don't really have any style requirements other than using **soft 4 tabs** for indentation and writing **readable** code.
It's always better to write more lines rather than cramping it all in one line (which I tend to do a lot).
## Comments
Always comment your code using the ***numpy*** style. There exists many plugins for automatically generating the substantial portion of the comments. I use [docblock](https://atom.io/packages/docblock-python) on atom, but I'm sure there's a plugin for your favourite editor too.
## Security
Try to implement secure coding standards that you know (feel free to edit this page). Here are some examples:
- Always validate the input. If it comes from the browser it can be easily tampered with using burp suite and similar proxy-based tools.
- I'll create custom error screens, but make sure you don't leak information when handling exceptions or edge cases.

## Testing
I don't know anything about testing, so please feel free to *develop* this section. I'll prefer an easy solution like doctest, rather than a complicated one that requires people 
to write testing code.


# Javascript | React
React is used for the frontend. If you're new to react, head to [scrimba react tutorial](https://scrimba.com/g/glearnreact).

## Style
Same with python
I don't really have any style requirements other than using **soft 4 tabs** for indentation and writing **readable** code.
It's always better to write more lines rather than cramping it all in one line.
Do not create folders inside the components directory. Composition > inheritence.

## Comments
Always comment your code using the ***jsdoc*** style. There exists many plugins for automatically generating the substantial portion of the comments. I use [atom-easy-jsdoc](https://atom.io/packages/atom-easy-jsdoc) on atom, but I'm sure there's a plugin for your favourite editor too.

## Testing
I don't know anything about testing, so please feel free to *develop* this section. Lookin' for an easy solution.
