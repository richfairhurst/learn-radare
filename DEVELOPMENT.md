## Style
I don't really have any style requirements other than using **soft 4 tabs** for indentation and writing **readable** code.
It's always better to write more lines rather than cramping it all in one line (which I tend to do a lot).
## Comments
Always comment your code using the ***numpy*** style. There exists many plugins for automatically generating the substantial portion of the comments. I use [docblock](https://atom.io/packages/docblock-python) on atom, but I'm sure there's a plugin for your favourite editor too.
