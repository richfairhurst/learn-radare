# OpenRadare
Interactive tutorial for Radare 2. [Link](https://xp073.github.io/openradare/tutorial.html)

## What is OpenRadare?

This is a highly-modified openvim clone for radare2. 

OpenRadare is a web-based project to let people quickly have a taste what kind of an editor Radare is.
Radare is considered to be very useful but can feel devastatingly opaque at first. Hopefully this tutorial makes people feel more comfortable to give it a chance.

OpenRadare is based on a custom engine that interprets radare commands. 
Fun fact: the engine operates directly on the dom but could be easily refactored to a model that is not view-dependent.
